Justify-centre

* flex-start: Items align to the left side of the container.
* flex-end: Items align to the right side of the container.
* center: Items align at the center of the container.
* space-between: Items display with equal spacing between them.
* space-around: Items display with equal spacing around them.
For example, justify-content: flex-end; will move the frog to the righ



Align-items

Now use align-items to help the frogs get to the bottom of the pond. This CSS property aligns items vertically and accepts the following values:
* flex-start: Items align to the top of the container.
* flex-end: Items align to the bottom of the container.
* center: Items align at the vertical center of the container.
* baseline: Items display at the baseline of the container.
* stretch: Items are stretched to fit the container.


flex-direction. 
* row: Items are placed the same as the text direction.
* row-reverse: Items are placed opposite to the text direction.
* column: Items are placed top to bottom.
* column-reverse: Items are placed bottom to top.

Flex wrap/flow/direction

* nowrap: Every item is fit to a single line.
* wrap: Items wrap around to additional lines.
* wrap-reverse: Items wrap around to additional lines in reverse.


align-content to set how multiple lines are spaced apart from each other. This property takes the following values:
* flex-start: Lines are packed at the top of the container.
* flex-end: Lines are packed at the bottom of the container.
* center: Lines are packed at the vertical center of the container.
* space-between: Lines display with equal spacing between them.
* space-around: Lines display with equal spacing around them.
* stretch: Lines are stretched to fit the container.
This can be confusing, but align-content determines the spacing between lines, while align-items determines how the items as a whole are aligned within the container. When there is only one line, align-content has no effect.
